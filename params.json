{"name":"Foundator","tagline":"The foundational software initiaitve","body":"Foundator\r\n=========\r\n\r\nFoundator is a software initiative that aims to provide essential foundational libraries that we feel are missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nManifesto\r\n---------\r\n\r\nWe shall produce no frameworks, only libraries. Frameworks take control, while libraries give control. We shall make our core libraries simple and straightforward. Complex functionality must be separated from and built on top of simple libraries. All our source code shall be released under a permissive free software license.\r\n\r\n\r\nLibraries\r\n=========\r\n\r\nScala\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIn Scala, our libraries live in the `org.foundator` package and Maven group. Our Maven artifactIds are prefixed with `foundator-` because some tools unfortunately require these to be globally unique.\r\n\r\n| Library      | Description |\r\n|--------------|-------------|\r\n| [json](https://github.com/foundator/json) | A JSON data structure that can be read from or written to a string, stream, writer or file. The focus is on simplicity, good error messages and conformance to the specification. All in less than 400 lines of code. |\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nAll our source code is available under the MIT License, which is a permissive free software license with the following template:\r\n\r\n| MIT License template |\r\n|----------------------|\r\n| <p>Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;copyright holders&gt;<p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<p>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.<p>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
