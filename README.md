Foundator
=========

Foundator is a software initiative that aims to provide essential foundational libraries that we feel are missing.


Manifesto
---------

We shall produce no frameworks, only libraries. Frameworks take control, while libraries give control. We shall make our core libraries simple and straightforward. Complex functionality must be separated from and built on top of simple libraries. All our source code shall be released under a permissive free software license.


Libraries
=========

Scala
-----

In Scala, our libraries live in the `org.foundator` package and Maven group.

* Json - A JSON data structure that can be read from or written to a string, stream, writer or file. The focus is on simplicity, speed, good error messages and conformance to the specification.


License
=======

All our source code is available under the MIT License, which is a permissive free software license with the following template:
